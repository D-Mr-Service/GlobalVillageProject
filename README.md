# GlobalVillageProject 
地球村计划
Earth Village is an open, collaborative project for all of humanity. We invite individuals, communities, developers, researchers, and businesses worldwide to participate in the design, auditing, and continuous iteration of this decentralized social system.  It uses decentralized identities (DID/VC) as the foundation for public identity, with identity-sensitive information encrypted at the field level using independent encryption and protected by post-quantum cryptography for long-term security. This ensures that while identities are verifiable and valid across the entire network, no one can access personal private information without the individual's authorization.

At the asset and housing level, real estate is bound and authenticated only through encrypted addresses/commitment values: the status and change records of properties are publicly accessible worldwide, but it's impossible to deduce ownership from the public registry. Transactions are completed in a verifiable but anonymous manner within a rule-bound witnessing process. Commercial assets are only available for lease, not purchase: rent automatically flows back and is equally distributed among residents in the surrounding area.  Businesses also contribute a fixed percentage (e.g., 5%) to the construction of public goods such as roads and public facilities, ensuring that value returns to the community in the long term.

The governance and execution layers employ a mechanism of "transparent rules, auditable processes, and revocable power": AI is used only as an auxiliary tool (for proposal organization, risk warning, and execution verification), and is constrained by clearly defined public principles and human oversight. This ensures that the system always prioritizes human dignity, freedom, and rights, and prevents any individual, organization, group, or single AI entity from gaining absolute control over others or the system, both institutionally and technologically.
